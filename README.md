# Diels_Alder_CO2
Scripts to reproduce figures in CO2 Diels Alder paper: \
Paper information: TBD

Dataset_and_PCA: to create the dataset, and perform PCA analysis as needed in the older version. \
Generate_new_diene: build new diene structures for computational screening. \
Previous_version_ML_prediction: an older version to train ML models and perform screening for new dienes. Keep for reproduction. \
Code_for_paper: Train ML models and perform screening in the paper. \
Additional details are provided in the scripts' comments.

feature_final, model_final, and scaler_final are the finalized parameters that can be directly used.
